Overview of the document: In this document you will find only examples of goals. It does not capture
all potential goals that could be used. The special education department does expect all SE teachers
to use Condition, Content, Criteria, Progress Monitoring and Date in each student’s IEP goal. IF the IEP
team writes a goal, the team needs to make sure there is time in the student’s schedule to receive
specialized instruction. This is especially important at high school, where support is provided within
courses.
1
Directions:
1. Analyze the student'
s present level of performance
a. MDT data
b. Intervention or IEP goal data
c. classroom data
d. Other
to identify a student’s skills, strengths, and weaknesses. This will ensure that goals are individualized.
2. Choose the appropriate goal condition, content, criteria, and progress monitoring tool based on the student'
s
present level of performance. The order of the condition, content, criteria, progress monitoring tool, and date can
be in any order that makes the most sense.
3. Goals should reflect the team
'
s professional opinion of a realistic goal for student progress over the upcoming
year and should be ambitious, but realistic.
4. The team needs to discuss and ensure that the goals provide the student a free and appropriate public
education (FAPE).
5. Determine if short term objectives or benchmarks are needed to outline small steps toward reaching the annual
goal. These are required for students on alternate assessment, but can be done for anyone. See short term
objective and benchmark guidance below.
6. Remember this document is just to help teams write goals, it is not all exhaustive.

Definitions of Terms:
Condition: The specific circumstances under which the student is expected to perform the target skill.
Content: The specific skill or observable behavior you want the student to perform.
Criteria: How well and how often the student must demonstrate to consider it mastered.
Progress Monitoring: How the skill or observable behavior will be measured.
Date: When the goal or objective will be achieved.
Short-term objectives: Measurable, intermediate steps between a student'
s present level of educational performance
and the annual goals established for the student. Short-term objectives are often used when the sub-skills leading to
the goal change over time. At least two short-term objectives (STO) are required for each goal.
Benchmarks: Measurable indicators of skill acquisition. They are broader than short-term objectives and typically
address major milestones. Benchmarks are often used when the skill or behavior remains the same, but the percentage,
accuracy, or rate change over time. At least two benchmarks are required for each goal.
Rate of Improvement: The amount of student growth expected.

***Note that progress monitoring can be difficult to graph if your baseline context (e.g., words) is different from your goal context (e.g., conversation).  You won’t be measuring apples to apples each month and therefore graphing won’t work. It is recommended that you choose the same context for both the baseline and the goal and then summarize specifics in the “Strengths” and “Needs” portion of the IEP. For example, you may have a goal for increasing from 0% in conversation to 80% in conversation. Then, in the Strengths/Needs, you would summarize how the student is currently practicing at the sentence level.

Transition High Use Goals


Transition Goal Reminders:
At least one transition annual goal is required for all students beginning with the IEP the year the student turns 14. 
Students may have more than one transition annual goal AND/OR the transition annual goal might be the only goal on the IEP. 
The transition annual goal is different from the Measurable Post Secondary Goals (MPSG) on the transition page.
Use individualized assessment results to form a transition goal that supports/connects to the student’s MPSG.
Transition goals state what the student will do or learn within the next year that will close an identified skill deficit related to the student’s MPSG. (social skills, communication, academic need, behavior, self-care, ect.)
Transition goals should be measurable and focus on skill/strategy development, not activity completion.
Transition goals should follow the same format as all other goals.
Transition goals must be individualized and not the same for each student.
