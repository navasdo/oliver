Assessment
Results including
Age-Appropriate
Transition-based
Assessments
and Student
Strengths:

Transition Assessments are an ongoing process of collecting data on the student’s strengths, preferences, interests and
needs, as they relate to the measurable postsecondary goals (MPSGs) for the student in the areas of independent living,
employment, education, and training.

Measurable postsecondary goals
based on
appropriate
transition
assessments

Education/
Training

Goal Types include Education, Employment, Independent Living Skills. These goals should reflect the desired outcomes
one year after graduation or existing services. If a student is going to attend the Independence Academy or other services
for students 18-21, these goals reflect the year after completion of that individualized programming.

Federal and State guidelines require a minimum of TWO transition assessments updated annually. Describe these in the
Transition Assessment Results section on the Transition Page and align to the MPSGs.
Refer to the LPS Transition Assessment Options Document
General Structure:
●​ Assessment #1, Name of Assessment, Date Given (Modifications if appropriate) - Choose 2-3 priority areas,
identify the strengths, preferences, interests and needs as identified by the assessment
●​ Assessment #2, Name of Assessment, Date Given (Modifications if appropriate) - Choose 2-3 priority areas,
identify the strengths, preferences, interests and needs as identified by the assessment
●​ Summarize additional assessments using the same structure - additional assessments may be needed to explore
areas indicated by student need, parent/guardian input, or present level of performance.

Employment
Independent
Living Skills

Measurable Post-Secondary Goals are developed based on assessment. Students should have input and assist in
development of the MPSGs. MPSGs should identify an outcome/behavior, not a process.

In the “strengths” box, list the student’s strengths, in sentence format. Strengths should be specific to the goal category
and emphasis should be placed on what the student can do; even though it is still a challenging area of learning.

Secondary IEPs with transition, indicate the post secondary goal that your annual goal will be (supporting,
education/training, employment or independent living (if applicable)). For example, writing (education/training)

Example Statements:
●​ Reading: STUDENT can retell the beginning and end of a story at DRA level 16.
●​ Behavior: STUDENT on-task behavior has increased from 50% of the time to 75% of the time. He/She is using a
mini-schedule to keep himself/herself on track.
In the “needs” box, list the student’s needs, in sentence format. Needs should be specific to the goal category and
emphasis should be placed on skills the student has “not yet” mastered, but in which he/she is working to gain proficiency.
Example Statements:
●​ Reading: On a recent oral retelling sample, (STUDENT) included 8 out of 15 main events, with 5 out of 15 events
in the correct sequence at DRA Level 16. (STUDENT’s) understanding affects his/her comprehension
performance in the general curriculum.
●​ Behavior: (STUDENT’s) teachers rated his/her on-task behavior the lowest in math class. He/She scored 40% of
the time on task in math due to his/her frustration with multiple-step math concepts.
In the “goal needed” box, select “No” if the IEP goal has been met, or if the IEP goal is no longer considered a priority
need. Select “Yes” if the IEP goal area is necessary and if the IEP goal is relevant to current programming. For students
who have needs that are being addressed by MTSS interventions, see this document: MTSS for Students in Special

Example Statements:
●​ The IEP team determined STUDENT is eligible for transportation to and from the school in the attendance area
due to the nature of the student’s disability.
●​ STUDENT is eligible for transportation to and from the school in the attendance area. At this time, the
parents/guardian have chosen to provide transportation.
○​ (Mark "yes" student qualifies and in the minutes section enter "0" minutes then write in the narrative:
"Student qualifies for transportation, but parents have chosen to transport.")
●​ STUDENT is eligible for transportation to and from the school in the attendance area. However, since
parent/guardian chose for the STUDENT to attend a school outside of the attendance area, the parent/guardian
provides transportation.

Related Services

Select each of the services needed and accessed by the student during the school year. Create a separate line for each
related service.
Definition: Related services also include school health services and school nurse services, social work services in schools,
and parent counseling and training. Related services do not include a medical device that is surgically implanted (including
cochlear implants), the optimization of that device’s functioning (e.g., mapping), maintenance of that device, or the
replacement of that device. This definition does not limit the right of a child with a surgically-implanted device (e.g.,
cochlear implant) to receive related services as listed in this definition that are determined by the IEP team to be necessary
for the child to receive FAPE;, or limit the responsibility of a school district to appropriately monitor and maintain medical
devices that are needed to maintain the health and safety of the child, including breathing, nutrition, or operation of other
bodily functions, while the child is transported to and from school or is at school; or prevent the routine checking of an
external component of a surgically-implanted device to make sure it is functioning properly.
​
Nursing Support
Invite a school nurse to IEP meeting. Consult with the school nurse regarding minutes. Minutes may be daily, weekly,
monthly, quarterly, or annually. If students need more than 200 minutes of nursing services or if a physician’s order
requires a licensed nurse to be present at the building site, contact the health service supervisor.
New IEPs or New to the District - If parents are discussing skilled nursing care at enrollment, consult school nurses prior
to enrollment.
Educational Support for Students Requiring Continuous Nursing Support Guidance:
1. Treatment nurses may assist the students they support with educational needs if the IEP manager deems that this is
appropriate to the student’s individual health plan.
2. The nurse would need to have the necessary training to provide this assistance.
3. The student’s educational plans will be in writing and additional adult support will be provided during times of transfers
and toileting.
4. This educational support will be provided only if there are no other ongoing health needs to address with the student at
that time.

they are needed in order for the child to succeed in regular education.)
Accommodations: Testing accommodations are changes in testing procedures meant to allow students to demonstrate
what they know and are able to do. When choosing accommodations, the goal is to obtain scores that accurately reflect a
student's knowledge and skills, not to unfairly inflate the student's scores. Accommodations do not change what is being
measured, or the difficulty of the assessment.

Extended School
Year

The team
considered the
need for ESY

Purpose of ESY: ESY is a service to prevent the loss of critical skills that may take substantial time to recover during the
next school year, and ESY is to facilitate maintenance of skills during extended periods of time when school is not in
session. Critical Skills are essential to the attainment of self-sufficiency and independence from caregivers. It is directly
related to the student’s disability, is identified in the IEP, and is considered on an annual basis. The skill must be
appropriate for the individual and must impact the student’s ability to remain in the least restrictive environment.

Amending vs. Unlocking Documents

Unlocking an IEP:  Student Document Unlock: Tree—Synergy SE—NTL—Student Document Unlock
 This feature allows a coordinator to unlock a finalized IEP or MDT report for editing purposes. 
Use the unlock feature when:
There is a data entry error (e.g., an incorrect date, or an omission of information discussed at the meeting). 
An IEP or MDT was finalized before a specialist entered his/her information.
Spelling/grammar errors.
Provide a copy of the revised document to the parent.
If a document is unlocked, be sure to have a plan to finalize it again ASAP.
At the building level, only Special Education Coordinators can finalize forms in Synergy.

Amending an IEP: 
The amendment feature allows a Coordinator to open a finalized IEP to add new information or update programming information. 

When a school team wants to propose minor changes to an IEP, an amendment can be utilized if the parents agree.  Follow this process:
The coordinator and relevant school team members contact parents.  This can be done through a phone call or email.  
Communicate with the parents about the proposed IEP changes.
If parents agree, send home the “Amendment SOD” which documents the proposed changes.
When parents return the form with a signature, amend the IEP (see below for directions).
On the cover page of the IEP in the “Efforts to schedule the IEP Meeting”, document what updates were made along with the date the parent signed the SOD.  Finalize the SOD, download it to your desktop, and upload it into the appropriate folder in Historical Docs. 
If parents do not agree, schedule an IEP meeting to determine the next steps.   

The amendment process may be used in the following situations: 
Adding or deleting an accommodation
When something agreed on during the meeting did not get documented correctly in the IEP and everyone agreed.  
Adding services to an already existing intervention
Adding or developing an ESY plan in the spring (e.g., when the IEP was held in the first semester and no ESY determination was made at that time).
Changing progress monitoring tools
Changing the frequency of progress monitoring
Adding or changing supports for personnel
Modifying the frequency of related service
Adding baseline data after already agreeing on a goal
Parent requested something after finalization and we agree
Rule 18/19/10 Placements
Alternate Assessment required documentation
MTSS updates

The next IEP review date will be one year minus one day from the original IEP meeting date unless the IEP team finds it necessary to change the review date.

Documenting Attempts to Hold SE Meeting Guidance

Documentation of efforts to schedule the SE meetings is REQUIRED. Three attempts to hold the meeting are needed.  Attempts to contact the parent can include phone calls, emails and letters.  

Parent/Guardian Contacted and Agrees to Meeting But Does Not Attend
1st Attempt: Schedule the meeting and when parents do not attend document the attempt to hold the meeting.  Contact the parent/guardian to reschedule ASAP while giving parents 5 day notice.
 
2nd Attempt: Schedule the meeting and when parents do not attend document the attempt to hold the meeting.  Contact the parent/guardian to reschedule ASAP while giving parents 5 day notice.

3rd Attempt: Schedule the meeting. Send the third meeting request and Third attempt Letter via certified letter (located in Ad Hocs) indicating the team will meet without the parent/guardian if they do not attend.  If upon the 3rd attempt to schedule and the parent does not attend, the team can meet without the parent. 

*5 day notice is not needed for Manifestation Meetings because they need to happen within 10 days of the incident.


Unable to Contact Parent/Guardian
1st Attempt: Schedule the meeting. Send the meeting request via certified mail. If the parent does not attend, contact the parent/guardian to reschedule ASAP while giving parents 5 day notice.

2nd Attempt: Schedule the meeting. Send the meeting request via certified mail. If the parent does not attend, contact the parent/guardian to reschedule ASAP while giving parents 5 day notice.

3rd Attempt: Schedule the meeting. Send the third meeting request and Third attempt Letter via certified letter (located in Ad Hocs) indicating the team will meet without the parent/guardian if they do not attend.  If upon the 3rd attempt to schedule and the parent does not attend, the team can meet without the parent. 

*5 day notice is not needed for Manifestation Meetings because they need to happen within 10 days of the incident.


Where to document attempts to hold the IEP meeting:
Staff will document the attempts to schedule along with the date and manner in which the meeting notice was provided to parents on the cover page of the IEP in the Attempts to Schedule section.
(Example: IEP meeting notice was provided to the parent on 1/25/24 by email.)


Where to document attempts to hold the MDT meeting:
Staff will document the attempts to schedule along with the date and manner in which the meeting notice was provided to parents in the Information Provided by Parents section of the MDT.
(Example:  MDT meeting notice was provided to the parent in person on 1/25/24.)
 Please use the format below to document the meeting attempts in the MDT.  This should be completed by the SE Coordinator.

IMPORTANT:  If the MDT Meeting is an Initial Placement into Special Education, a parent/guardian must participate and consent to placement prior to completion of the MDT process. The initial process may not move forward without parent consent.  For reevaluations the team may move forward with reverification without parent involvement. 


Where to document attempts to hold a Manifestation meeting:
Staff will document the attempts to schedule along with the date and manner in which the meeting notice was provided to parents on the cover page of the Manifestation paperwork in the Attempts to Schedule section.
(Example: Manifestation meeting notice was provided to the parent on 1/25/24 through US mail.) This should be completed by the SE Coordinator.

A Manifestation meeting must occur within 10 school days of a decision to change the placement due to discipline (because the child with a disability has violated a code of student conduct).



-------------------------------
EDUCATIONAL SURROGATES
Information for School Administrators


IMPORTANT INFORMATION:  A reminder that case managers and current school personnel cannot serve as surrogates.

STEP 1:  
Look to see if an educational surrogate is assigned.  There are two places where these can be found:
The first thing is the DHHS Superintendent’s letter.  This letter will state who has educational rights.  Towards the bottom of the letter, there will be a section called “Educational Surrogate for Education Decision-Making”.  If you cannot find it, ask Carol Winant.  Under this heading, there are a couple of options that could be stated here:
The second is Educational Guardianship paperwork and Application for Educational Rights (AER) with LPS Student Services.

STEP 2: 
If a person or people are listed as surrogate (appointed by a judge) or AER through Student Services, please contact them for any meetings related to the student’s educational needs.

STEP 3: 
If an Educational Surrogate (or AER through Student Services) is not identified, take a look at the following information on the Superintendent’s Letter.  Immediately below the statement, “Educational Surrogate not identified”, the letter will describe the current parents’ rights, whether parents have chosen not to be involved with the student, if parents cannot be located, or if parental rights have been terminated.  If you have questions about the superintendent letter, ask Carol Winant.

STEP 4:
If the letter states that the mother’s or father’s rights are intact, and s/he has indicated a desire to participate in educational decision-making, LPS must make every effort to contact them, document the attempts, and would not assign a surrogate.

STEP 5:
If the parents have: chosen not to be involved with the student, cannot be located, or parental rights have been terminated; and you have determined an educational surrogate is needed, please email Maddie Maag explaining your request.  You must attach a copy of the Superintendent’s Letter to the email, if there is one.  Maddie will work on assigning the surrogate.  Once a surrogate parent has been confirmed, Maddie Maag will mail letters to the surrogate and building principal with information about the assignment.  She will also email the surrogate parents’ contact information to the Special Education Coordinator, so they can proceed with scheduling any meetings.

STEP 6:
Any educational surrogate not listed on the Superintendent’s Letter and not assigned by Maddie Maag, must go through a short training that will be provided by Amy Maschka/Maddie Maag.
An example:  If there is no surrogate identified, and foster parents agree to serve as surrogate, they would need to go through the short educational surrogate training.  However, if they were listed on the Superintendent’s Letter as surrogate (as appointed by a judge), they would not need the training.



-------------------------------
IEP Excusal Form Guidance

Excusal forms should be used sparingly.  It’s always best to have the team in attendance.
The staff member must complete the IEP Excusal Form & send it to the coordinator so it can be presented at the IEP meeting.
 The parent must agree to the excusal ahead of time. Agreeing at the beginning of the meeting is fine.
If parents do not agree to the individual being absent, the meeting should be rescheduled.  
The parent needs to sign the IEP Excusal Form.
The IEP manager should mark the team member as excused on the signatures and IEP cover page.  
Upload the Excusal Form into the process folder.  
Excusal forms may NOT be used for MDT meetings.  All required members must be in attendance according to Rule 51.





-------------------------------
Question
Answer
How do I indicate a parent has received their notice?
Special Education meetings can be scheduled with parents in person, by phone, or by email. When a meeting is scheduled, the school must provide a meeting notice to the parent.  Meeting notices can be provided in person, by email, sent home with the student, or through US mail.   

Schools will follow this documentation process regarding notices of meetings:
IEP Meetings: Have the parent sign the meeting request. Staff will document the attempts to schedule along with the date and manner in which the meeting notice was provided to parents on the cover page of the IEP in the Attempts to Schedule section. (Example: IEP meeting notice was provided to the parent on 1/25/24 by email.)
Manifestation:  Have the parent sign the meeting request. Staff will document the attempts to schedule along with the date and manner in which the meeting notice was provided to parents on the cover page of the Manifestation paperwork in the Attempts to Schedule section.  (Example: Manifestation meeting notice was provided to the parent on 1/25/24 through US mail.)
MDTs:  Have the parent sign the meeting request. Staff will document the attempts to schedule along with the date and manner in which the meeting notice was provided to parents in the Information Provided by Parents section of the MDT.  (Example:  MDT meeting notice was provided to the parent in person on 1/25/24.)
How do I indicate that a parent is waiving their 5-day notice?
Indicate permission on the Meeting Request in the “comments” section and have the parent initial, or handwrite permission on the notice and have the parent initial.
What do I do if the current meeting notice does not match who is in attendance?
We need always to give parents prior notice of who will be at a meeting.  If the list of participants changes, send home a new Meeting Request before the meeting. 
 
If the list of participants changes the day of the meeting, call the parent before the meeting to give them notice, then create a new Meeting Request for the parent to sign at the meeting.   Follow question 2 for parents waiving their 5-day notice. Update the changes on the IEP cover page in Synergy SE.


If the list of participants changes at the last minute, notify the parents before starting the meeting. Indicate the changes on the Meeting Request in the “comments” section and have the parent initial, or handwrite changes on the notice and have the parent initial.  Follow questions 2 for parents waiving their 5 day notice. Update the changes on the IEP cover page in Synergy SE.
How do parents give permission for the attendance of non-LPS outside providers (like VR)?
Have parents check the box “I give consent for the individuals listed in the Other Specialist…” and sign.

If a representative was invited but unable to attend the meeting, document on the Meeting Request in the “comments” section and have the parent initial or handwrite their absence on the notice and have the parent initial.

Update the change on the IEP cover page in Synergy SE.
My meeting is going to be an MDT and most likely an IEP. Do I mark both or print 2 separate notices?
You will need to create two different notices. One for the MDT meeting and one for the IEP meeting. 

Follow question 1 for how to indicate a parent has received their notice.

 Follow question 2 for parents waiving their 5 day notice.
Who are all the required team members at an IEP meeting? 
Parent
Student
Regular Education Teacher
Special Education Teacher or Provider
Individual to Interpret Results 
School District Representative

**Anyone who serves the student should be in attendance.
What do I do if the student does not attend the IEP meeting?
Keep the student on the meeting notice. Indicate they are not attending on the Meeting Request in the “comments” section and have the parent initial, or handwrite the change on the notice and have the parent initial. 
  
Indicate the student did not attend on the IEP cover page in Synergy SE.
What do I do if only one invited parent attends the IEP meeting?
Keep both parents on the meeting notice.

Indicate which parent did not attend on the IEP cover page in Synergy SE.
What is the process for excusing an IEP member? 
See IEP Excusal


What date do I use for confirmed date if we cannot get a hold of the parent after three attempts?
Use the date that the school team determined they would hold the meeting, then note in the comments box you could not reach the parent to confirm the meeting. The meeting confirmed box is required on the form to finalize.

If a student who receives special education has a BIP, it needs to be documented in the IEP. The purpose of the BIP is to ensure we are providing positive behavioral support to students. Make sure BIPs are progress monitored and are being followed with fidelity. ALL BIPS NEED TO BE IN SYNERGY.

The BIP should be developed, monitored and updated by the IEP team for verified students.  For a student who is eligible for special education services in any area, the IEP team is the body responsible for making decisions regarding any change of placement or service delivery models.  MTSS team members can join the IEP team when discussing the BIP.  

If the student’s behavior is not related to their disability and the team is implementing MTSS before looking at a verification, in the “behavior impedes learning” section of the IEP: XXXX’s behaviors have begun to impede his learning.  The IEP team has agreed to implement MTSS strategies to evaluate and monitor student’s behaviors prior to determining if the student requires specialized instruction relating to his behaviors.  The following strategies will be implemented: _________. 

If the student’s behavior is related to the student’s disability, in the “behavior impedes learning” section of the IEP: XXXX’s behavior impedes learning.  See goals section.  XXXX also has an FBA/BIP.  The behavior of concern is _____ with the replacement skill being _____.  The following strategies will be used to support the student.    

In a Behavior Intervention Plan: Note the behavior intervention plan can be found in the IEP under the “if behavior impedes learning” section.

Make sure copies of FBAs and BIPs are sent home to parents along with the IEP.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS HEALTH INFORMATION
Determine a workflow to get this information from the school nurse.  The school nurse is not required to attend the IEP meeting.

Example 1
If a health plan is deemed necessary, choose the appropriate drop-down and add the following statement in the text box.

 
Health diagnosis:   ADD ALL STUDENT DIAGNOSES
A student’s health may have an impact on academic success.  As part of the IEP, this student has one or more of the following health plans which have been developed with parents/guardians and are updated as needed with the parents/guardians; action plan (student health information provided by parent or healthcare provider), emergency action/classroom plans (emergency plan created by school nurse for classroom teachers), nursing treatment plan (school plan of care for skilled nursing or medical care at school written by School Nurse) and/or individual health plan  (plan of care written by School Nurse with student goals and regular evaluation). 





Example 2
If the student has a diagnosis, however, no health plan is necessary, choose the appropriate drop-down and add the following statement in the text box. 


Health diagnosis:   ADD ALL STUDENT DIAGNOSES
A student’s health may have an impact on academic success.  This student does not have any health plans at this time. The student's need for a health plan will be evaluated annually with the parent and the IEP team. 





Example 3
If there are no diagnoses to consider,  choose the appropriate drop-down and add the following statement in the text box. 

Not applicable




-------------------------------
Calculating Nursing Service Minutes for an IEP
If a student has an IEP and is receiving routine nursing services, this needs to be included in their IEP.  You do not need to attend every student’s IEP meeting, but you do need to include service minutes.  Meet with your school’s SPED coordinator to determine how you will communicate about IEP meetings and provide nursing minutes for the IEP.  You can run a Synergy report for your school with a list of students and IEP minutes (SEIEP002).  Minutes can be calculated by day, week, month, quarter, semester or school year. 	 	 	 					
Calculating Minutes					
Calculating “Total Service Minutes per Week”
Convert each service on the student’s IEP to minutes per week
Minutes per day should be multiplied by 5
Minutes per month should be divided by 4 
Minutes per quarter should be divided by 9				
Minutes per semester should be divided by 18
Minutes per year should be divided by 36
										
Examples:
• A student receiving catheterization 2x daily would be reported as 40 minutes per day for skilled services and 200 minutes per week.  You could also include 2 minutes per week (1 hour annually) for case management which would include creating and maintaining a plan of care with parents.
					
• A student receiving continuous support nursing including the bus ride would be 7 hours a day and would be reported as receiving 3500 minutes per week.  You could also include 3 minutes per week (2 hours annually) for case management by the school nurse.
													• A student with asthma who receives an inhaler daily before PE would be 5 minutes every day and reported as 25 minutes per week and 1 minute  per week (1/2 hour annually) for case management.										
• A student with orders for Diastat could include case management and field trips which may be reported as 15 minutes per week (1 hour case management, 3 field trips x 2.5 hours=510 minutes per year.)					
• A student who has a nurse assigned to ride the bus to and from school (15 minute bus ride each way) for PRN suctioning would be reported as having 77 minutes per week (75+ 2 minutes per week for case management).

SUMMER SERVICES-- ESY Decision Making

ESY Background: ESY services include special education and related services provided for children with disabilities during periods when school is not in session. 

Purpose: ESY is a service to prevent the loss of critical skills that may take substantial time to recover during the next school year.

Decision Making: Each year, the IEP team considers the individual needs of the student and determines ESY services for a student by reviewing evidence concerning regression and recoupment of critical skills. Not all children with disabilities need ESY services.

Student Need:  Students needing ESY are those whose current IEP data shows a) regression of critical skills during breaks that take extended periods of time to recover; b) learning that occurred during the regular school year will be SIGNIFICANTLY jeopardized if ESY services are not provided; and/or c) IEP objectives targeting critical life skills at an emergent breakthrough point and the interruption of instruction of these critical life skills caused by the school break is likely to prevent the child from receiving some benefit from his or her educational program during the regular school year; d) nature and/or severity of the student’s disability; and/or e) special circumstances that interfere with child’s ability to benefit from education.

Critical Skills:  A Critical Skill is essential to the attainment of self-sufficiency and independence from caregivers. It is directly related to the student’s disability, is identified in the IEP, and is considered on an annual basis. The skill must be appropriate for the individual and must impact the student’s ability to remain in the least restrictive environment. Critical skills can include academic, behavioral, communication, emotional, motor, social, and/or self-determination.

Degree of Progress: The IEP team must review the child’s progress on any IEP objectives targeting critical life skills, and determine whether, without ESY, the child’s degree of progress on those IEP objectives is likely to prevent the child from receiving some benefit from his or her educational program during the regular school year.


Directions to Complete the ESY Form: The ESY Decision-Making Form is to be completed after the IEP Team has made the ESY decision with parents. Each question in the ESY process must be discussed as part of the IEP meeting and completed on the decision-making form.  Data used to support the ESY decision must also be uploaded to the form.  





ESY Decision Making Questions:
What is the existing Present Level of Performance? 
IEP teams must use their professional judgment based on existing data concerning critical skills to determine if ESY services are necessary. They should be able to describe the student's current educational program and progress related to possible need for ESY services.  
Data must be provided to support decision-making. 

What are the critical skills addressed in the Present Level of Performance?

Which of those critical skills addressed in the Present Level of Performance need to be maintained due to the student being at risk for regression and/or loss of benefit from learning during the regular school year?

What data about critical skills supports the need for ESY?  
Case managers will have to upload the appropriate data used to make this ESY decision. 
This could include charts, graphs, tables, etc. showing regression over extended breaks or newly emerging skills.

*Data shows regression of critical skills following breaks in instruction for the student.

*Data shows the student needs significant instruction to recoup the skills after a break in instruction (more than 60 days).

*Data shows regression without recoupment of the student’s critical skill.

*Data shows interfering behaviors that will prevent the student from receiving some benefit from his/her educational program next year without provision of ESY services.

*Data shows special circumstances could prevent the student from receiving some benefit in his/her educational program next year.

*Data shows the student’s learning that developed during the regular school year calendar will be significantly at risk if ESY services are not provided.

*Data shows ESY will support reasonable readiness for next school year.

Based on the IEP Team review of Present Level of Performance data, does the student need ESY services?

ESY Planning: Planning will address the who, what, where, and when of the student's ESY services and service delivery. Appropriate service delivery options could include:
• school-based programs that vary in length of schedule (e.g., two days/week for 3 weeks, 2 weeks, etc.)
* grouping of children with similar goals and objectives,
• limited child contact, perhaps 3-4 times during the summer to prevent regression,
• a week of intensive review just prior to the beginning of the school year
* multi-school shared programs,
• community based programs, and transition opportunities.

LPS Districtwide and Statewide Assessment Options for Students with IEPs or 504 Plans
Participation Guidelines
LPS English, Math, Science, and Social Studies District Assessments/DCAs
All students will participate in the LPS District Assessments with one of four options: (1) without accommodations, (2) with allowable LPS testing accommodations and/or modifications, (3) instructional level assessment (instruction and assessment based on individual needs), or (4) NSCAS Alternate Assessment ELA, Math, and Science.

State Tests: NSCAS and ACT
All students will participate in the NSCAS Growth ELA, Math, and Science or ACT with one of three options: (1) without accommodations, (2) with NDE/ACT allowable testing accommodations, or (3) NSCAS Alternate Assessment ELA, Math, and Science with or without accommodations.

PreACT
All tenth-grade students will participate in the PreACT with one of four options: (1) without accommodations, (2) with allowable testing accommodations, (3) instructional level assessment (instruction and assessment based on individual needs), or (4) NSCAS Alternate Assessment.

MAP Growth Reading and Math
All students in grades 3-8 will participate in MAP Growth Reading and Math. All students in high school reading courses will participate in the MAP Growth Reading. There are three participation options: (1) without accommodations, (2) with allowable testing accommodations, or (3) instructional level assessment instead of MAP Growth (instruction and assessment based on individual needs). 

DIBELS 8 for the Nebraska Reading Improvement Act
Students in grades K-2 will take the DIBELS 8 Benchmarking Assessments as a universal screener in fall, winter, and spring as required by the Nebraska Reading Improvement Act. Students who have a reading goal in their IEP will not be identified for an Individual Reading Improvement Plan (IRIP) because they are already receiving additional support in reading. These students may still participate in the DIBELS Benchmarking Assessments if the information will be useful. If a student identified with a disability in reading needs more support beyond the allowable accommodations on DIBELS, the IEP team can consider other options (e.g., other diagnostic assessments, instructional level assessment). English learners in their first two years of receiving specialized services in English are also exempt from taking the DIBELS 8 Benchmarking assessment for universal screening. 

Cognitive Abilities Test: CogAT
All 2nd grade students will participate in the CogAT Screener with or without accommodations, unless the IEP team determines the test will not provide useful results. CogAT results are primarily used for the gifted program. 

PSAT, SAT, and ACT
Students, along with their parents, determine when it is appropriate to participate in the PSAT, SAT, and ACT (beyond state testing participation in 11th grade). For students who need accommodations, the IEP Manager, Special Education Coordinator, and ACT Accommodations Coordinator will assist in providing documentation from the student’s educational records to the testing companies as appropriate.

English Language Proficiency Assessment for the 21st Century (ELPA21)
All students currently receiving ELL Services and those who qualify under the state definition of “Limited English Proficient” will participate in the ELPA21. Students with disabilities may receive appropriate accommodations as specified in their IEPs or 504 Plans (see Testing Accommodations section for more information) and an alternate version of the assessment is available for students who qualify for the NSCAS Alternate Assessment.
Instructional Level Assessments (ILA)
Individuals who are unable to take the regular assessments with accommodations and who are not participating in the NSCAS Alternate Assessments should participate in instruction and assessment based on individual needs. For example, a fourth grade student reading at the kindergarten level might complete the appropriate McGraw-Hill Wonders Adapted or WondersWorks reading assessments as an instructional level assessment instead of the Reading Unit Tests (DCAs). A secondary student not enrolled in a general education math class might complete the classroom assessments for the alternate courses (e.g., &Life Skills Math, &High School Math Concepts) instead of the Math district assessments. Instructional level assessment should be noted in the student’s IEP in “Assessment” section on page 7. This instructional level assessment option is not available for students with 504 Plans. All students will participate in the NSCAS tests.

NSCAS Alternate Assessment (NSCAS AA) in ELA, Math, and Science
A student may participate in the NSCAS AA in ELA, Math, or Science (based on the Nebraska Extended Indicators) when the IEP team determines their cognitive ability and adaptive behavior prevents completion of the general academic curriculum; their course of study is primarily functional and life-skills oriented; and they require intensive, frequent, and individualized instruction. Participation in the NSCAS AA is not based solely on a student's disability; deficiencies due to absence or lack of instruction; or language, social, cultural or environmental factors. Qualifying students have been identified with severe cognitive issues. Students who participate in the NSCAS AA may also participate in other assessments, as appropriate. Evidence that the student qualifies for alternate assessment (extended indicators) should be included in the “Results of the initial evaluation or most recent evaluation” section of the IEP. NSCAS AA should be noted in the student’s IEP in the “Assessment” section. For Assessment Area, select theAlt (Ext) NSCAS) and for Assessment Method, select “Extended Indicators.” For more information about whether a student qualifies for the NSCAS Alternate Assessments, please see the NDE guidelines. IEPs will be reviewed in September and October to verify that students qualify for the alternate assessment according to NDE guidelines. Information about how to document alternate assessment is available in the IEP Manual and examples of students who do and do not meet the NDE criteria for alternate assessment are also available.  Students participating in the NSCAS AA tests may have allowable accommodations.

LPS District-wide Assessment Options for Students with IEPs or 504 Plans

Elementary and Middle School Participation Guidelines with Examples: NSCAS

NSCAS Growth ELA and Math
NSCAS Science (S)
All students in grades 3-8 will participate in the NSCAS Growth ELA and Math or the NSCAS Alternate ELA and Math in the spring with or without appropriate, allowable accommodations.
For allowable accommodations see “NSCAS Accessibility Manual” or “NSCAS Accessibility List.”
IEP teams may determine if fall and winter (if applicable) testing are in a student’s best interest. NDE requires fall testing for almost all students so that growth information can be calculated from fall to spring. The IEP team should consider whether the information gained from the fall and/or winter assessments would be useful when deciding about participation.
Students in grades 5 and 8 will participate in the NSCAS S or NSCAS AAS (Alternate Assessment Science) in spring as appropriate (no fall or winter testing are available for science).
For allowable accommodations see “NSCAS Accessibility Manual” or “NSCAS Accessibility List.” 

Note: when documenting accommodations for NSCAS in the student’s IEP, use the language from the state documents as much as possible. List one or more of the NDE accommodation titles with sufficient description for someone not on the IEP team to know what the accommodations are (e.g., text-to-speech, computation supports: calculator, primary mode of communication: student points to answers). Please remember that accommodations documented for the NSCAS tests should be similar to those used on classroom and district assessments throughout the school year.


High School Participation Guidelines with Examples: ACT and PreACT

All students in grade 11 will participate in ACT with or without appropriate, allowable accommodations (determined by ACT). The exception is students who participate in the NSCAS alternate assessments. Grade 10 students will participate in the PreACT. The PreACT provides practice for the ACT and information for the student to use for preparation for the ACT. IEP teams may determine that the PreACT is not appropriate for some students (e.g., students with intellectual disabilities who do not qualify for alternate assessment). IEP teams should consider whether the information from the PreACT will be useful and what sort of practice will be appropriate for the ACT for students. Accommodations for the PreACT should be as similar as possible to those that are likely to be approved (by ACT) for the ACT. For allowable accommodations, see the list provided by ACT. Accommodations for the ACT are submitted in the TAA System using the instructions the Test Accessibility and Accommodations (TAA) User Guide beginning on page 19 and approved by ACT.

K-12 Participation Guidelines with Examples: ELPA

ELPA
All students in grades K-12 who are eligible for English Learner (EL) services will participate in the ELPA with or without appropriate allowable accommodations. An alternate version of the ELPA is available for students who participate in the NSCAS Alternate Assessments. 
If a student meets the following criteria, NDE may grant an exception for up to three of the four domains (Reading, Writing, Speaking, Listening) as appropriate.
The student has a documented disability or impairment (IEP, 504) applicable to the domain.
Even with accommodations, the student cannot engage (access) with the domain.
There was consultation with the educators supporting language development and the IEP team in establishing a need.
All eligible students must complete at least one domain. An example would be an exception for the Speaking test for a student who is difficult to understand because of speech articulation issues or is nonverbal.
Allowable audio supports are already built into the test. Text-to-speech is not an option.
Speech-to-text supports and scribe/adult to assist with navigating technology or recording responses are allowable as accommodations. Students must do the speaking themselves for the Speaking test.
For other accommodations, see the testing accommodations section.

Elementary Participation Guidelines with Examples: DIBELS 8

DIBELS 8 Assessments
All students in grades K-2 will participate in the DIBELS 8 Benchmark Assessments with or without appropriate allowable accommodations unless the IEP indicates another assessment option is needed. Students with a reading goal in their IEPs are not required to take DIBELS 8 for the purposes of an Individual Reading Improvement Plan (IRIP) under the Nebraska Reading Improvement Act, but IEP teams may choose to include these students in DIBELS 8 if the information will be useful for instructional/intervention planning.
Allowable accommodations include setting and scheduling adaptations, large print materials, and having the student read the test aloud to themself on the MAZE. No reading support beyond what is embedded in the test are allowable and time limits cannot be extended for scores to be meaningful. The subtests must be given in the designated order because of discontinue rules. For other accommodations, see the testing accommodations section. For students who are also English learners, please see this reference.
For students with a disability for whom the allowable accommodations in DIBELS are not sufficient to meet their needs, yet diagnostic information is wanted to identify learning gaps and pinpoint where to start Tier 2 or 3 instruction and/or intervention, consider giving a diagnostic assessment such as the Hasbrouck Phonics Decoding Survey (p. 78) or some of the Phonological and Phonemic Awareness Assessments (p. 34-69) in the Wonders Placement and Diagnostic Assessment Handbook. Heggerty has assessments for grades K-2 on the Tier 2 page of the libguide, Bridge the Gap is also a diagnostic assessment of phonemic awareness for grades 2+.  Programs such as Sonday, and Phonics for Reading have placement assessments to identify where to start instruction built into the program. 
For students participating in the NSCAS ELA Alternate Assessment, the IEP team will report student performance on the Life Skills Rubric.

Testing Accommodations: Questions for Use in IEP and 504 Plan Meetings
Testing accommodations are changes in testing procedures or environment meant to allow students to demonstrate what they know and are able to do. When choosing accommodations, the goal is to obtain scores that accurately reflect a student's knowledge and skills, not to unfairly inflate the student's scores. Accommodations do not change what is being measured or the difficulty of the assessment. By contrast, modifications do change what is being measured and reduce the expectations for students. Modifications are not allowable on some assessments and may have grading implications when they are allowed.

Completion of the standardized testing format should be followed to the fullest degree possible.
Accommodations should be used judiciously.
Testing accommodations chosen should reflect only those used on a regular basis to address the student's disability.
Not all accommodations used in instruction may be appropriate for testing.

Answers to the following questions may help determine if testing accommodations are appropriate for the student:

Is an accommodation needed to accurately measure the student's knowledge and skills?

Setting
Does the student require accommodations in setting?


Scheduling
Does the student require accommodations in the testing schedule?


Timing
Does the student require accommodations in the timing of the test?


Presentation/Response
Does the student require accommodations in the presentation of the test or alternative response formats/methods?


Example IEP Statements

Testing accommodations should be listed in a student's IEP or 504 Plan. Testing accommodations should be written in the "Accommodations/Modifications" and “Testing” sections of the IEP. Specific accommodations for specific assessments must be noted in the IEP or 504 Plan. For example, an IEP for a student with an orthopedic disability might reflect that the student will participate in the NSCAS ELA with the following accommodations: individual testing, speech-to-text support, extended time, and flexible scheduling. Another IEP for a different student might reflect that the student will take the Math and Science DCAs with the following accommodations: individual testing, extended time, mark responses in test booklet, etc. Another IEP for a student with a severe learning disability might read, “S will participate in the MAP Growth with extended time. For the MAP Math test, assistance with reading will be provided. S will read the MAP Reading aloud quietly as needed.”On Synergy, the “Statewide Assessment” section in the Testing tab of the IEP will address:
Testing Grade: Grade level tests the student may take. Be sure to add assessments for the student’s grade level for the next school year if this IEP will be in effect during testing during that time (e.g., if the IEP is completed in May).
Assessment Areas: Choose appropriate area: NSCAS, ACT, or Alt (Ext) NSCAS 


Administration Methods include: Standard assessment with or without accommodations and Alternate Assessment based on Extended Indicators.



Why the  student cannot participate in regular assessment and why Alternate Assessment was chosen.
Example: Student’s curriculum is based on Extended Indicators and Life Skills. Instruction is modified.

Accommodations: Prioritize accommodations. Multiple assessment accommodations may be designated for a student as long as they are needed in order for the child to succeed in the assessment activities. Accommodations should be a regular part of instructional services.


Reporting of Testing/Assessment Results

It is critical that students with disabilities be included in data reporting. Aggregated and disaggregated results from the NSCAS and ACT tests and the NRTs (e.g., MAP) are reported annually for the whole district and by building on the state website, to the local public, and to students and parents. DCA results are used for instructional planning and student and parent reporting. Results from the NSCAS Alternate Assessments are reported on the state website and locally. LPS will maintain records of accommodations students receive on specific tests.

LPS District-wide Assessment Options for Students with IEPs or 504 Plans

Testing Accommodations: Scribes and Speech-to-Text (STT) Support

The use  of STT support over human scribes is preferred on open-ended items if appropriate primarily because of issues related to test security. Technological solutions also encourage students to become more independent. Allowing students to practice with different writing supports will help you decide which supports are more appropriate for particular students. 

Guidelines for Using Scribes on District Assessments

Prior to beginning the assessment, the scribe will inform the student that they will write down exactly what the student dictates including sentences, paragraphs, punctuation, capitalization, and word choice. The student should indicate which letters to capitalize,  where to insert punctuation, indentations, and spelling as independently as possible.
The student will generate the ideas and organization for the writing assessment. The scribe should not be helping the student with composition input.
The scribe is required to write down exactly what the student says without interpretation. No verbal or visual prompting is allowed. 
If the student uses a word incorrectly either in terms of grammar or pronunciation, the scribe will write the word as stated by the student.
On the second day of the state writing assessment, the student will revise and edit by completing their own revisions/edits on their rough draft OR by dictating changes.
The student may then dictate (if necessary) to the scribe so that the final copy may be scribed.

**As a reminder, the scribe method should be noted on the student's IEP and used regularly during ongoing writing instruction if it will be used on the assessment. Students using a scribe may need extended time on the assessment.


Testing Accommodations: Students Reading Tests Aloud to Themselves

Research on the effectiveness of accommodations supports allowing students to quietly read passages and test items to themselves. This accommodation is allowed on all district and state assessments. Students using this accommodation will need to be tested in a setting where they will not disturb other students who are also testing. Some options include individual testing, spreading small groups of students out in a classroom, or providing whisper phones or headsets that cover students’ ears. It is important to allow students to practice taking assessments with whatever option is selected on a regular basis.
Testing Accommodations: Reading Tests Out Loud to Students or Text-to-Speech (TTS) Supports

Tests differ in the extent to which test items may be read out loud to students. Most English Language Arts tests that measure reading or related skills may not be read to students as an accommodation and text-to-speech supports (TTS) may not be enabled. For example…
The DIBELS 8 and MAP Growth Reading tests may not be read to students and TTS may not be used.
McGraw-Hill Wonders tests may be read to students or TTS may be used only as a modification (which has implications for grading). 
For the NSCAS ELA TTS may be used only on test items, not passages and human readers are only allowed if students meet criteria for paper/pencil testing. 
For more information about whether tests may be read to students, please see the appropriate administration manual, curriculum documents, or the NSCAS NDE Accessibility Manual.

Teachers should provide the accommodations listed in the student’s IEP or 504 Plan for a given assessment. As IEP teams discuss possible accommodations for a student, they should keep in mind that reading tests out loud benefits some students and negatively impacts the performance of others. Consequently, teams should carefully consider the potential benefit or harm to each student for which they are considering reading the test. This decision should be based on multiple factors including the student’s current reading level as well as the social and emotional impact reading the test may have on the student’s performance. TTS should only be selected for state and district testing if the student uses audio supports on a regular basis on classroom assessments.

Guidelines for Reading Tests/Items Aloud to Students/TTS:
Verify that reading tests aloud or TTS is an allowable accommodation for a particular test (see above). 
Think about the usefulness of the information gained from the test results if items are read to the student or TTS is enabled. Will the assessment results serve the intended purpose if items are read to the student?
Students identified as possibly benefiting from this accommodation should choose whether to have the test read to them or not or whether to use TTS.
Students may not need whole tests read aloud. Allow the student sufficient practice to determine how much assistance is helpful. Some students may only need some words or phrases read. TTS supports often allow students to highlight specific words or phrases or to indicate where TTS should begin reading within a paragraph. TTS supports allow students to control the pacing of their work. Practice on specific test platforms prior to the test is critical so that students know how to use TTS on that test.
Students using TTS may be able to participate in testing with their class by using headphones. Schools can encourage students to use TTS if needed by encouraging any students who want them to use noise-canceling headphones (not plugged in to the device).
For students who need whole tests or all items read aloud, attempt to keep groups small. Try to group students according to your understanding of their pacing and support needs. Watch carefully for students who may be falling behind but may be hesitant to ask for a question to be repeated.
Make certain the test administrator who will read items aloud has adequate preparation. They should have read through all materials, practiced reading aloud, and be familiar enough with the content area and vocabulary on the test to pronounce words correctly. Be careful to follow test directions about assistance on word meanings. Often, the test administrator may clarify general directions, but may not explain or simplify language in directions for specific items.
When reading items aloud, avoid giving hints to the correct answers through inflection, emphasis, pauses or nonverbal cues.
TTS supports minimize the possibility of providing clues to correct answers and are not disruptive to other students in the same room.
Try to arrange the testing situation so other students are not distracted by a proctor reading the test. It can be distracting to read to some students in a room while others are taking the test silently and we don’t want the students taking the test without accommodations to hear the test being read aloud. Use a separate location, if possible.
Document information about students for whom tests were read similar to other provided accommodations.

Testing Accommodations: Adaptive Tests

Adaptive tests (e.g.,, MAP Growth, NSCAS Growth) adjust the difficulty of the items based on student responses until the test is offering items close to the student's ability level. Some adaptive tests (e.g., MAP Growth, NSCAS) may be given in several sittings. The teacher or student pauses the test and the student picks up where they left off on another day. The paper/pencil option for NSCAS is limited to students who have a visual impairment, students with medical needs who cannot use a computer screen (e.g., concussion, TBI), and other extenuating circumstances that do not allow online testing. The paper/pencil version is a fixed-length test written at grade level. It will not adapt to student needs like the online version.
Sample IEP Accommodations for Use in the “Accommodations/Modifications” and “Testing”
Sections of the IEP (Assessment)

ASSESSMENT- Accommodations: Accommodations for district and state assessments are to be recorded in Section 7 of the IEP (Testing) on Synergy. It is required to record the accommodations specific to the assessment. 

Accommodations: Prioritize accommodations. Multiple assessment accommodations may be designated for a student as long as they are needed in order for the child to succeed in the assessment activities. Accommodations should be a regular part of instructional services.

Add a line for each assessment during which the student will need accommodations. Select the assessment from the pull down menu. Select all accommodations needed for each assessment. Only choose needed accommodations. Some examples include:

Guidance in Working with College Entrance Exams Agencies

The college entrance exam agencies have specific guidelines for the identification of appropriate accommodations for the SAT, AP, PSAT, ACT, etc.

Accommodations allowed on college entrance exams are often the same as those provided on a student’s IEP, but not always.

Guidelines and decisions by college exam agencies prevail in determining which accommodations will be granted to a student taking a college entrance exam.

IEP Teams will assist a student and their parents in obtaining directions and completing the appropriate accommodations request forms. The ACT Accommodations Coordinator will submit appropriate paperwork to ACT for students taking the ACT as part of the state-wide assessment in 11th grade.

IEP Teams will also assist for other ACT administrations and for PSAT, SAT, and AP tests by providing necessary school records documentation required by the college exam agencies. School staff members will complete the eligibility sections that require school input. This assistance must be done in accordance with the due dates posted by the college entrance exam agencies.
